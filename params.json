{"name":"Mois","tagline":"Module Integration Simulator v2","body":"Module Integration Simulator\r\n============================\r\n\r\nPared down version of the integration core.\r\n\r\nReimplementation of Dominik Bucher's original at\r\nhttps://github.com/edinburgh-rbm/moi-sim.git\r\n\r\nBuilding and Releasing\r\n======================\r\n\r\nThis section is mostly of interest to those working on MOIS itself. It\r\nmay also be useful if you need to use a non-released version with\r\nother software.\r\n\r\nMOIS is an [http://www.scala-sbt.org](SBT) project and you need SBT to\r\nbuild it. Once it is installed, MOIS can be fetched and the tests run\r\nlike so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:edinburgh-rbm/mois.git\r\ncd mois\r\nsbt +test\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `+test` argument causes the tests to be run with both Scala 2.10\r\nand 2.11.\r\n\r\nIf the tests have run successfully, MOIS may be deployed to the local\r\nIVY cache so that it can be found by other SBT projects that include\r\nit as a dependency:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsbt +publish-local\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are a core developer and have the correct permissions and keys,\r\na new release of MOIS may be published to the global Maven\r\nrepository. This is so that users of the software can just list it in\r\ntheir dependencies. This is done with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n### increment version number in build.sbt\r\ngit tag -s -u 84225CBC mois-vAA.BB.CC\r\nsbt +publish-signed\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
