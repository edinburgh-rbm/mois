 * A `Var` is basically a named value of a certain type. It is operated

 *
 * Some things need to be said about the identifier and the scope. The
 * identifier is meant to be globally unique and could sensibly be an RDF
 * resource, perhaps in shortened curie notation though this is not
 * enforced. This identifier is used to find out if a variable is the
 * same across two or more processes. So an example might be to use
 *
 *     InChi:ZKHQWZAMYRWXGA-KQYNXXCUSA-N
 *
 * for our friend ATP.
 * 
 * Scope is used to create exclusive buckets that contain the same
 * variable. For example a simulation of two cells might have the same
 * substance in both cells but it doesn't make sense to pool it as a
 * variable. Therefore these cells would have different scopes.
 *
 * The effect of this is that when a global state table is derived from
 * the individual states of several processes, their individual state
 * variables or variables are merged only if the identifiers and the
 * scopes match.
